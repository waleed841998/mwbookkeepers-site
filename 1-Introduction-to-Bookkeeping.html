    <p>
      For example, if you purchase office supplies, receive a payment from a customer, or pay your employees ‚Äî all these actions are recorded in <a href="1-Introduction-to-Bookkeeping.html">bookkeeping</a>. Accurate records help you know exactly where your money is going and coming from.
    </p>

    <h2>üåü Why is <a href="1-Introduction-to-Bookkeeping.html">Bookkeeping</a> Important?</h2>
