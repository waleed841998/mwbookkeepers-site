    <h1>Introduction to Bookkeeping</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>ðŸ“˜ What is Bookkeeping?</h2>
    <p>
      Bookkeeping is the simple process of recording and organizing all the financial 
      transactions of a person or a business. Itâ€™s like keeping a diary, but instead of writing 
      about daily events, you write about money coming in and money going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you buy office supplies, receive a customer payment, or pay salaries â€” 
      all these are recorded in bookkeeping. This helps you know exactly where your money 
      is going and where it is coming from.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸŒŸ Why is Bookkeeping Important?</h2>
    <p>
      Bookkeeping is important because it gives you a clear picture of your financial health. 
      Without it, you are simply guessing how much you earned or spent. With proper records, 
      you can make smarter decisions, save money, and avoid financial stress.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Importance for Different People</h2>
    <h3>1. For Individuals</h3>
    <p>
      Bookkeeping isnâ€™t just for companies â€” it can help individuals too. Imagine you want 
      to track your household expenses. By recording your income and spending, you can 
      identify where you might be overspending (like on dining out) and start saving for 
      future goals (like buying a car or a house).
    </p>

    <h3>2. For Small Businesses</h3>
    <p>
      Small businesses often run on tight budgets. With bookkeeping, owners can keep track 
      of cash flow, see which products or services are profitable, and prepare for tax time 
      without stress. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A local bakery can use bookkeeping to know how much profit it 
      makes after paying for flour, sugar, staff salaries, and electricity bills.
    </p>

    <h3>3. For Larger Companies</h3>
    <p>
      For bigger businesses, bookkeeping is essential for growth. Investors and banks 
      always want to see proper financial records before providing loans or funding. Without 
      accurate bookkeeping, a company may lose opportunities to expand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A construction company planning to build more projects will 
      need detailed bookkeeping records to convince banks to lend them money.
    </p>

    <h2>âœ… Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you are an individual, a small shop owner, or a large company, bookkeeping 
      is the foundation of financial success. It is not about complicated math â€” it is about 
      being organized and prepared.
