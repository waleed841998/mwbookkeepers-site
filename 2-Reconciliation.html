    <h2>ðŸ”„ What is Reconciliation?</h2>
    <p>
      Reconciliation is the process of comparing your financial records against bank statements, invoices, and receipts to ensure everything matches. 
      Think of it as double-checking your <a href="1-Introduction-to-Bookkeeping.html">Bookkeeping</a> to avoid mistakes and spot discrepancies early.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you record a customer payment in your <a href="1-Introduction-to-Bookkeeping.html">Bookkeeping</a> system but it doesnâ€™t appear in your bank account, reconciliation helps you find and fix the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸŒŸ Why Reconciliation is Important</h2>
    <p>
      Reconciliation ensures that your financial records are accurate, which helps you make better business decisions. It also reduces errors, prevents fraud, and ensures smooth financial reporting.
      Accurate reconciliation is crucial for <a href="3-Tax-Support.html">Tax Support</a> purposes because your reported income and expenses must match your actual financial activity.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Reconciliation for Different Entities</h2>
    <h3>1. Individuals</h3>
    <p>
      Even if you are managing personal finances, reconciliation can help track spending and prevent overdrafts. By reconciling your bank account with your <a href="1-Introduction-to-Bookkeeping.html">Bookkeeping</a> records, youâ€™ll know exactly how much money is available and avoid errors.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Small Businesses</h3>
    <p>
      Small businesses often face cash flow challenges. Reconciliation helps you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify that invoices and payments are recorded correctly in <a href="1-Introduction-to-Bookkeeping.html">Bookkeeping</a>.</li>
      <li>Identify missing or duplicate transactions.</li>
      <li>Prepare accurate reports for <a href="3-Tax-Support.html">Tax Support</a> compliance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A retail store can reconcile its daily sales against bank deposits to ensure no money is lost or misrecorded.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Larger Companies</h3>
    <p>
      For bigger businesses, reconciliation is critical for audits, investor confidence, and regulatory compliance. Accurate records ensure that all transactions are accounted for and that the company is prepared for <a href="3-Tax-Support.html">Tax Support</a> obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A construction company reconciling multiple accounts prevents discrepancies in payroll, vendor payments, and customer deposits.
    </p>

    <h2>âœ… Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Reconciliation is the bridge between your <a href="1-Introduction-to-Bookkeeping.html">Bookkeeping</a> records and reality. Without it, errors can go unnoticed, cash flow becomes unpredictable, and compliance becomes risky.  
      At <strong>MW Bookkeepers</strong>, we ensure your reconciliation process is accurate, reliable, and ready for any financial decision or <a href="3-Tax-Support.html">Tax Support</a> requirement.
